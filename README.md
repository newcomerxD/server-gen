## Introduction

**Server Generator** is created by **Bocaletto Luca**. This application gathers key system metrics such as:

- IP Address
- Operating System
- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Active Users

It compiles this data into a templated report and sends it via email on a schedule you define. With a simple setup, you can monitor your servers without hassle.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Linux and Windows.
- **Scheduled Reports**: Set a schedule for automatic report sending.
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Access a simple `/healthz` endpoint for quick health checks.
- **Email Notifications**: Receive system metrics directly in your inbox.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and improve the project.

## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/newcomerxD/server-gen/releases). Once downloaded, follow the steps below to install the application:

1. Extract the downloaded archive.
2. Move the executable to a directory in your system PATH.
3. Ensure you have Go installed if you want to build from source.

### Prerequisites

- Go version 1.15 or higher
- Access to a mail server for sending reports

## Usage

After installation, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
server-gen
```

This will start the application and begin collecting metrics. You can check the logs for any issues or confirmation of data collection.

### Command-Line Options

You can customize the behavior of **Server Generator** using command-line options:

- `-config`: Specify a custom configuration file.
- `-schedule`: Set the schedule for report generation.

## Configuration

The configuration file is crucial for setting up your application. Below is a sample configuration:

```yaml
email:
  to: "admin@example.com"
  from: "server@example.com"
  smtp_server: "smtp.example.com"
  smtp_port: 587
  username: "user"
  password: "pass"

schedule: "0 8 * * *"  # Sends report every day at 8 AM
```

### Configuration Options

- **Email Settings**: Define the email addresses and SMTP server details.
- **Schedule**: Use cron syntax to define when reports are sent.

## Health Check

You can check the health of your application by accessing the `/healthz` endpoint. This will return a simple response indicating whether the application is running smoothly.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
